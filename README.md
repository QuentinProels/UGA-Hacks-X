# UGA-Hacks-X
Project for UGA Hacks X
Tyler Simile and Quentin Proels

The purpose of our projects was to create model using the GAN AI learning model to randomly generate rock climbing holds for the purpose of 3d printing

Tools Utilized: Pytorch GAN AI, ChatGPT was used for implementing the GAN AI and learning python :3, Scipy, numpy, Trimesh, Perlin noise generator, and Skimage
The Dataset the AI was trained off was provied by BHToolset

The main problem was having to scale all of the files properly so the AI would scale everything correctly. In the end our greatest challenge was having the AI generate properly populated structured that were varied.
