the downscaler is only doing it for the x and y dimensions leaving the z dimension long which is what resulted in the 
stls being cut off on the right and all of the files looking the same because when stretched they all looked the same.

I think that the voxel grid has to be padded to a square first and then scaled down in order to make everythin work properly.
